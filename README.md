# Instance Segmentation Model using Segmentation Models Library
This project aims to build an instance segmentation model using the Segmentation Models library in TensorFlow. The goal is to accurately segment instances of objects in images.

## Introduction
Instance segmentation is a computer vision task that involves not only detecting objects in an image but also segmenting each instance of the detected objects. In this project, we use the Segmentation Models library to create a powerful instance segmentation model.

## Requirements
Python 3.6 or later

TensorFlow 2.0 or later

Segmentation Models library

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

## Implementation

### Setup

To set up the project environment, install the required dependencies using the following command:

#### pip install tensorflow segmentation-models numpy pandas matplotlib

### Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, we preprocess the image and mask data. The images are resized to a uniform size, and the pixel values are normalized to a range of [0, 1]. Additionally, the masks are converted to grayscale format.

### Augmentation Techniques
The data augmentation pipeline includes a variety of transformations that are randomly applied to each input image with a certain probability p. The transformations included in the pipeline are as follows:

HorizontalFlip: Randomly flips the input horizontally.

VerticalFlip: Randomly flips the input vertically.

RandomRotate90: Randomly rotates the input by 90 degrees in increments.

ShiftScaleRotate: Applies random shifts, scales, and rotations to the input.

ElasticTransform: Applies elastic deformations to the input.

GaussianBlur: Applies Gaussian blurring to the input.

GaussNoise: Adds Gaussian noise to the input.

OpticalDistortion: Applies optical distortion to the input.

GridDistortion: Applies grid distortion to the input.

### Data Generator
To efficiently handle large datasets during training, we create a custom data generator class that loads data batches on-the-fly. The data generator enables us to work with large datasets without loading the entire dataset into memory.

### Model Architecture
We experiment with various model architectures available in the Segmentation Models library, including UNet, LinkNet, and FPN. We choose the most suitable architecture based on performance.

### Loss Functions
For training the instance segmentation model, we implement custom loss functions to optimize the model's performance. The loss functions include a combination of Dice Loss and Binary Cross-Entropy Loss.

### Training
To train the instance segmentation model, we use the model.fit function. During training, we also use data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.

### Evaluation
After training the model, we evaluate its performance on a separate validation dataset. The evaluation metrics include IoU (Intersection over Union) score and Dice coefficient.

### Results
We present the results of the trained instance segmentation model, including performance metrics and visualizations of the segmentation output on test images.

### Conclusion
In this project, we successfully built an instance segmentation model using the Segmentation Models library. The model shows promising results in accurately segmenting instances of objects in images.
